  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p>Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

  <p>
    These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of SMS services
    powered by Lead Recovery Systems (“we”, “us”, or “our”) when you contact a
    participating business.
  </p>

  <h2>Service description</h2>
  <p>
    Lead Recovery Systems provides a missed‑call recovery service that helps
    service businesses (for example, HVAC companies) text you after they miss
    your call. Messages are related only to your service request, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduling or confirming a visit.</li>
    <li>Responding to an emergency request.</li>
    <li>Providing quotes or estimates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Consent to receive messages</h2>
  <p>
    By calling or texting a phone number that uses our service, and where the
    business displays a disclosure that SMS may be used to follow up on your
    inquiry, you agree to receive text messages about that inquiry. Message
    and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies based on your
    interaction with the business.
  </p>

  <h2>Opt‑out and help</h2>
  <p>
    You can opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying
    <strong>STOP</strong>. You may reply <strong>HELP</strong> for help or
    contact the business directly using the contact details they provide.
  </p>

  <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to use our service for any unlawful purpose, and understand
    that we may suspend or restrict messaging in order to protect users and
    comply with carrier or legal requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update
    the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the service after changes
    means you accept the revised Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact us</h2>

    For questions about these Terms, contact:
